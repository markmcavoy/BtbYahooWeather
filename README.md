BtbYahooWeather
===============

DotNetNuke module to display the weather conditions using the Yahoo RSS weather feed.

## Background

This module was originally created 2007 and released on the Bite The Bullet site http://www.bitethebullet.co.uk/WeatherFeedModule.aspx
The project had the source code moved to GitHub in 2013 with the aim of adding new features available in DNN7, namely DAL2 and Razor templates.

You are free to download and use the module and sourcecode. If you are looking for a compile module to install then you should visit the project page here http://www.bitethebullet.co.uk/WeatherFeedModule.aspx

## Screenshots

The module can either use a XSLT or Razor file to convert the raw weather data into HTML. You are also able to make your own templates using the ones provided as a reference.
