&lt;p&gt;Bite The Bullet - Yahoo Weather Feed Module&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module will display the weather and two day forecast for a given area. 
  You can define the temperature scale to use either Celsius or Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started you need to enter the weather code for your location that you 
  wish to display. To get this visit weather.yahoo.com and search for your location 
  and view the page. The weather ID will be the last part of the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you search for Manchester on the Yahoo! Weather home page, 
  the forecast page for that city is http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/UKXX0092.html. 
  The location ID is &lt;strong&gt;UKXX0092&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
  You then just enter the code UKXX0092 into the module and you'll get weather 
  information for Manchester on your DotNetNuke portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather feed is cached in the database for 60 minutes, this is TimeToLive 
  value that Yahoo publish in there RSS feed. This will improve performance and 
  also stop busy sites from getting a warning about over use.&lt;/p&gt;
